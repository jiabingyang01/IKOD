## üéØ Overview
![VCD](figs/pipeline.png)
- We investigate the relationship between Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) performance and their visual attention, revealing that as the sequence length increases, the model‚Äôs attention to the image diminishes. This diminishing attention leads to performance degradation and errors in the generated responses. 
- We introduce IKOD, an image attention-guided key-value merging collaborative decoding strategy. This method endows text sequence with high attention on image using key-value merging and integrates the augmented decoding process with the original decoding process to obtain a more accurate output distribution.
- IKOD does not require additional training or external tools, which is more easily applicable to various models.


## üïπÔ∏è Usage
### Environment Setup
```bash
conda create -n IKOD python=3.10
conda activate IKOD
cd IKOD
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running

To run experiments on POPE with LLaVA 1.5 or InstructBLIP, use the following commands in the eval folder:
```
cd experiments
bash cd_scripts/llava_pope.bash
bash cd_scripts/instructblip_pope.bash
```
To evaluate model performance on POPE, use eval_pope.py.

For other datasets, modify the file paths and prompts in corresponding files to generate results and evaluate model performance following the guidance of their original repositories.

## üèÖ Experiments
- **IKOD significantly mitigates the hallucination issue across different LVLM families.**
